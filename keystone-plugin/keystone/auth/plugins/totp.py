"""Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) auth plugin

TOTP is an algorithm that computes a one-time password from a shared secret
key and the current time.

TOTP is an implementation of a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC).
It combines a secret key with the current timestamp using a cryptographic hash
function to generate a one-time password. The timestamp typically increases in
30-second intervals, so passwords generated close together in time from the
same secret key will be equal.
